## UX
### Project Goals
The primary goal of QUICKFIRE QUIZ is to provide a quick and fun quiz experience to the user at the touch of a button, that is easy to interact with and that provides a quick moment of light enjoyment, entertainment and test of some basic general knowledge questions. The website is designed for ease of use as the game player selects each answer, automatically progressing through the questions in a straight forward manner. The playability of the game allows the user to easily restart the game at the click of a button and try again, making QUICKFIRE QUIZ a playable experience.


#### User Goals
* To have a challenging but seamless quiz experience
* Interact with the website in an intuitive manner
* To identify with the playful color and logo of the quiz
* To easily operate QUICKFIRE QUIZ on all devices 

## Features
* #### Logo and welcome message
  * The logo has been created in a simple pixelated format of a flame, designed to match with the name QUICKFIRE QUIZ, sparking initial interest for the game player in a fun and playful format. The game has a simple retro block styling which is echoed by the use of a pixel style logo. The welcome message is simple and bold to explain in essence what the game is meant to do for the user. The high contrast purple against the white background suggests fun and adds to visual appeal.

* #### Start and restart buttons
  * The start and restart buttons are enlarged to prompt the game player to take action, and when clicked automatically trigger the game to play or replay. The grey buttons create high contrast with the red background of the game area.

</p>

* #### Question and answer area
  * The question and answer area is easy to navigate with a simple 4 option layout to choose from. The border has a heavy weighted black outline to draw focus to the intent of the game and to guide the user into the area to interact with. When the user clicks on their chosen answer the next question automatically loads for ease of use.

</p>

* #### Score area
  * The score area is designed with high contrast in mind and uses a bright green with black bold text to draw the eye to the screen as it updates when in play mode. When the player chooses an answer the score area automatically updates, and also resets to zero when the user clicks the restart button ready for the next game.

## Features Left To Implement
 * Color changing game area - when the game is complete the game area will turn from red to green to signify the end of the round, turning back to red when the player clicks the restart button. This would enhance the usability and playability of the game.
 * Additional levels - the game will have 3 levels of increasing difficulty to further engage the player with further challenge. The addition of a level indicator in the game area to signify to the player the stage they have reached in the game.
 * Larger font in the question and answer area to make the game easier to see when on the go, or for elderly users with visual impairment.
